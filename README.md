## 3. task
- I'm `Django Rest Framework`, because I'm most familiar with this framework (and it's http server)
- set your working directory to `extra_credit`
- run server with `./manage.py runserver` it'll start web server on port `8000`
- I created user, you can log to the admin with username `test` and password `test` (I know it's not the most secure password, but for demonstration it's enough) at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)
- In `admin` you can add, manage Document and tags
- I uploaded my test `db.sqlite3` with `media` files, even it should not be part of the repo, just for demonstration purporses.

Thanks for letting me any comments about this.
